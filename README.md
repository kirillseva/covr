Track test coverage for your R package and (optionally) upload the results to
coveralls.

# Compatibility #
Covr is compatible with any testing package, it simply executes the code in
`tests/` on your package.

# Coveralls.io Installation #
If you are already using [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org) simply add the following lines
to your project's `.travis.yml`.

```yml
r_github_packages:
  - jimhester/covr

after_success:
  - Rscript -e 'library(covr);coveralls()'
```

Alternatively, if you want to use another CI service, you can specify your
secret repo token for the repository, found at the bottom of your
repository's page on Coveralls. Your ```after_success``` would
then look like this:

```yml
after_success:
  - Rscript -e 'library(covr);coveralls(repo_token = "your_secret_token")'
```

Also you will need to turn on coveralls for your project at <https://coveralls.io/repos/new>.

# Usage #
Iterative usage of `covr`.

## REPL ##
```r
# if your working directory is in the packages base directory
package_coverage()

# or a package in another directory
package_coverage("lintr")

# zero_coverage() can be used to see only uncovered lines.
zero_coverage(package_coverage())
```

## Shiny App ##
A [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) application can also be used to
view coverage per line.
```r
cov <- package_coverage()

shine(cov)
```

# Implementation #
`covr` tracks test coverage by augmenting a packages function definitions with
counting calls.

The vignette
[vignettes/how_it_works.Rmd](https://github.com/jimhester/covr/blob/master/vignettes/how_it_works.Rmd)
contains a detailed explanation of the technique and the rational behind it.

You can view the vignette from within `R` using

```r
vignette("how_it_works", package = "covr")
```

# Compiler Compatibility #

If your package has compiled code `covr` requires a compiler that generates
[Gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) compatible
output.  It is known to work with clang versions `3.5` and gcc versions `4.2`.
It should also work with later versions of both those compilers.

It does _not_ work with `icc`, Intel's compiler.
